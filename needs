  is the current database info ,

  now we have to add contacts 

  pipelines are like - SMAM , sale , khseerasree , general subsidy , irrigation subsidy 

stages - sale , supply , installation , sale completed , feedback , demo etc ,

contacts have pipelines and stages and dates of each day when a customer moves from one stage of a slected pipline to another 

dates are saved for first in first out for sale , low waiting number first ,

also there should be add fields to save files or values , admin should be able to add a new field that field can be file or value , which can be chosen by the admin 

eg - description , feed back , saakshi pathram(file) , 

when pipeline change stages also change dynamically in a dropdown , and those are set by the admin

also for each customer there is a code , in that code there is the unique userid of people who participated in the sale ,that field value is seperated by slash / eg 1/23/45 the the numbers are the userid of people who were assigned the  , when one customer enquiry move from one stage to another the last person to take part in the sale is rewarded by a point there are two tables to store total points of each user and another with points add datetime to mark all progress so that montly perfomance summary of each salesman can be colected
